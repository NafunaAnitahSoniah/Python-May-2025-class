#Below we are creating variable names num1, num2 with values 60, 200.
num1,num2 = 60,200
ans = num1 + num2
print(ans)
#Another way of writing the above
num1 = 60
num2 = 200

#Syntax_of_Variable_names
#A variable name should not start with a number eg 1num
#A variable name should not start with a special character eg #num
#A variable name should not have spaces eg 'my num' instead use the 'underscore(_), my_num'or 'myNum'- this is a carmel notation
#A variable name should not start with a capital letter eg Num
#avoid using special key words as variables eg 'for, if, in, not in, print, else, is, is not, and, or, not ...'
 
#PLEASE_TAKE_NOTE
#The process of creating variables is called "declaring" eg on line2
#The process of storing a value in the variable is called "initialising"
#In Python we declare and initialise at once eg on line2
#In Python, a single compelte instruction is called a 'statement'
#two or more statements make up what we call a "code"
#A statement that evaluates a value is called an "expression" eg line2 evaluates to 260
#Python stops executing where it finds an error and ignores the preceding lines of instructions
#Python is an interpreted language, so it uinterprets all lines of code until it finds an error
#Some other languages will not run at all when they see an error, and they are called compiled langauges e.g. C, C++, Java
