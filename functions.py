#Functions are the backbone of a programming language

#A function is a name block of code (group of statements performing something)
#Functions logically group your code

num1, num2 = 10,20
print(num1 + num2)


def Add(): #Add() is the name of the function
    num1, num2 = 10,20
    print(num1 + num2) #won't print until you call the code to run

Add() #This calls the code to run.

def Subtract(): #name of the function
    num3, num4 = 40,20
    print(num3 - num4) #won't print until you call the code to run

Subtract() #This calls the code to run.
